                                     ChangeLog
	                             =========
									 
Version: 1.01,  initial release
-------------------------------
-- created a ChangeLog file and started logging the changes

-- created  .doc versions of README and Changelog for Windows users
  
-- replaced the 16 bit IO by considerably faster code

-- renaming of the individual tools to match the naming systematics of the 
   F-TexTools. The latter serve to making the remaining Celestia textures 
   in highest quality on normal home computers. 

-- replaced standard floor() and nint() rounding routines by much faster ones,
   using "magic numbers" based on Sree Kotay's xs_RoundToInt() and 
   xs_FloorToInt(), http://www.stereopsis.com/sree/fpu2006.html 

-- made it work also for Linux, using the fix from
   http://www.wrcad.com/linux_numerics.txt
   
-- replaced the original single pass resize_to_power_of_two algorithm with a
   faster double pass one.

-- the overall speedup amounts to about a factor of TWO!
   
-- In all cases the tool nvimgdiff from the new nvidia-texture tools was
   instrumental to assert that the generated images were /identical/ to the 
   original ones after implementation of the speed-up code.

-- the VT-tiles generation tool now directly produces PNG formatted tiles 
   (instead of PPM format)! This allows their immediate use in Celestia or 
   further packing into the high-quality DXT5nm formatted tiles by means of 
   the new OpenSource nvidia-texture-tools.
   
-- overhauled considerably the output logging during operation of the tools.

Version: 1.5 released
---------------------
-- added a new command line application 'nmtilesDXT' that produces direct
   high-quality output in the dedicated DXT format DXT5nm supported by Celestia.
   The DXT compression is based on the NVIDIA-Texture-tools 2 (NVTT), version
   2.0.4 at release time. 

-- Fixed a typo in 'nmtiles', which made the command line parameter heightmapunit
   inaccessible.
   
Version: 2.0pre1 released
