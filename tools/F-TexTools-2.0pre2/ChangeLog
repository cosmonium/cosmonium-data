                                     ChangeLog
									 =========
									 
Version: 1.0pre1,  initial test release
---------------------------------------

-- modify example 2) of README to eliminate a possible cause for misunderstandings
-- add benchmark times for my 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo/ 2 GB RAM DELL Latitude D620 
   notebook under Windows XP in README

Version: 1.0pre2   
----------------

-- created a ChangeLog file and started logging the changes

-- Created a separate binary Windows version with an Installer, README.doc 
   and ChangeLog.doc for greater convenience of inexperienced Windows users. The
   installer includes a registry entry such that all tools are known by name in any
   Windows directory after installation!

-- README/README.doc:

   * Modified example 2) to eliminate a possible cause for misunderstandings
     (width of generated file specmap.bin)
   * Added benchmark times for my 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo/ 2GB RAM DELL Latitude
	 not ebook besides the times for my Desktop machine (Linux)

-- tx2pow2:
   Completed the help text to include bpp = 4

-- F-texTools.iss/F-TexTools-1.0pre2.bin.exe
   Added installer for a binary version in Windows

Version: 1.0pre3
----------------

-- replaced standard floor() and nint() rounding routines by much faster ones,
   using "magic numbers" based on Sree Kotay's xs_RoundToInt() and xs_FloorToInt(),
   http://www.stereopsis.com/sree/fpu2006.html 
-- made it work also for Linux, using the fix from
   http://www.wrcad.com/linux_numerics.txt
-- replaced the original single pass resize_to_power_of_two algorithm with a
   faster double pass one.    									 
-- In all cases the tool nvimgdiff from the new nvidia-texture tools was
   instrumental to assert that the generated images were /identical/ to the
   original ones after implementation of the speed-up code.

-- Added new command line tool, png2bin, that may be very useful! With it’s help
   any .png textures are converted to bpp x 8 bit integer binary format, that is
   supported by all other tools.

   The tool png2bin is strictly the inverse of bin2png, such that
   png2bin < testfile.png | bin2png bpp width > out.png

   with nvimgdiff testfile.png out.png ==> 0.000

Version: 1.0pre4
-----------------   

--	added a new command line application 'txtilesDXT' that produces direct
    high-quality output in DXT formats DXT1/DXT3/DXT5 supported by Celestia. The
	high-quality DXT compression is based on the NVIDIA-Texture-tools 2 (NVTT),
	version 2.0.4 at release time.


Version: 2.0pre1
